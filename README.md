# Spring Boot REST Swagger 

### Spring boot example with REST and spring data JPA

### Endpoints

Simulate a UUID generator by creating sequences of numbers, written out as strings. If the resulting string is under 30 characters long, it should be padded, if it’s over 40 characters long – then it should be truncated.


REST Spring Boot API endpoint that implemented function that generates these simulated sequences. Possible parameters of x,y,z maybe be set with request.

 

Use this rule for generating number sequences:

1.     Start with a randomly generated (real) number as the base.

2.     If the number is even, then divide by x=2.

3.     If the number is odd, then add y=7.

4.     Check for longest palindromic sub-sequence.

5.     At least z=5 rules should run. 

6.     At least half of numbers should be generated by lines # 2 and 3.
